We have modified the original FedNTD code to include HYDRA in it.

1. Install necessary requirements.
2. Run the command python ./main.py --config_path ./config/fedntd.json to run fedntd or replace fedntd.json with fedavg.json to run fedavg.

3. In BaseServer.py in the algorithms directory, comment or uncomment lines 90-92 to select no-attack and attack settings, respectively.

4. The loss function coefficients can be modified in algorithms->fedntd->criterion.py in the forward function.

5. The config file is config->fedntd.json. You can change the parameters there if you wish to.

6. These steps were performed to generate the results for FedNTD. Set the seed to 1999.
